I am a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Excel, and data visualization, currently working at Virtue Analytics in the product maintenance domain. Over the past 6+ months, I have analyzed large-scale financial aid data, consolidated information from 50+ U.S. colleges, and optimized reporting workflowsâ€”improving accuracy by 15% and reducing reporting time by 35%.

During my internship, I enhanced model accuracy by validating 100+ academic transcripts, resolved anomalies to boost data readability, and improved decision-making efficiency for the development team.

Beyond professional work, Iâ€™ve completed impactful projects, including:

Digital Music Store Analysis: Uncovered customer spending patterns with SQL and Excel, improving revenue efficiency by 15%.

WAZE Navigation App: Built a machine learning model in Python to predict churn, reducing churn rate by 15% and identifying key drivers of user retention.

ðŸŽ“ I hold a Masterâ€™s in Computer Applications (AI & ML) from LNCT University with an 8.0 GPA, and a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Applications from MCU University.

Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to solve business problems, optimize processes, and provide actionable insights. Currently, Iâ€™m looking to connect with professionals in analytics and explore opportunities to grow in data-driven roles.
